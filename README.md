# Hi there! 🌞 I'm Dorahely 🌞

### Get to know me ...
Former Buyer at Levi Strauss & Co. transitioned into Software Engineering. With a proven track record, I effectively managed two multi-million dollar Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) businesses for US/CA. Beyond my software engineering expertise, I have strong data management and analytical skills, complemented by a creative POV honed over 6+ years in the fashion industry.

As I continue expanding my knowledge and refining my new skills, I am looking to solve more complex problems by diving deeper into the technical realm.


Outside of my professional career you can catch me surfing, searching for the best bagel, or attempting a recipe from Bon Appétit.
